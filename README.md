The database ‘Aarhus Stadsarkiv’ is freely accessible from Github, where the censuses 1801 to 1860 from the Aarhus City Archives Online Datasets repository can be found. The dataset is open and public, so the paper and the subsequent results fulfil the quota for reproducibility. The censuses convey a kaleidoscope of people in Aarhus and will be used to analyse and visualise developments in the occupation and economic mobility, focusing on the unmarried young women and men. Children under the age of 10 could work in 19th-century Denmark, however, the scope of this paper will be limited to the occupational mobility of unmarried men and women (ages 16 to 70 after the marriage laws of consent in the ‘Danske Lov’ of 1683: ‘16 år for kvinder og 20 år for mænd’). This will be with the use of OpenRefine to clean the datasets, and R and RStudio to compose visualisations of said dataset with the use of ‘ggplot’ and ‘tidyverse’ functions.
